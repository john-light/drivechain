- Support = either actively advocating for the soft fork, or at least willing to run full node software to enforce the Drivechain BIPs once they're activated.  
- Oppose = does not want the soft fork to be activated and enforced by the bitcoin network (miners + economic full nodes).  
- Names should be in alphabetical order by last name, if the last name is known, or first name, if no last name is known.
